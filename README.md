# chromarks
This repository is a mirror of Chrome extension "Chromarks" version 2.5.0. This is the last version before bunch of unnecessary permissions added along with an annoying "this page is in your bookmark" notification.

This extension can be installed in Chrome's developer mode by using the "Load unpacked extension" button.
